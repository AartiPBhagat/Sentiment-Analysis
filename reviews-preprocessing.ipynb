       "161244  The accommodation was good. The first impression about the location was not good. It looked like a social neighborhood but that could be because it was similar to the ones I have in my home country and because it was the first time in Berlin too. But at night the location was quiet and calm. The room did not have curtains to fully stop light from the window. I had to block the light with the blanket which was not easy to breath. If you have light sensitivity then you might want to bring a eye night patch.<br/>The host were very nice and Ece was very fast to respond and flexible with the check-in time.<br/>It was my first time using airbnb and this bedroom was a good experience.   \n",

The apartment was easy to find and very well located, just a few blocks from the \"Kapelle der Versöhnung,\" (on the old east/west border) and a subway station. It was well-equipped, clean, and functional. Walking in the evenings along the nearby memorials / information sites / parks associated with the wall was very pleasant. The center of the city was also reachable by foot in about 30 minutes. Some meter-readers did knock on our window at around 9:30 in the morning on our last day (before we were fully clothed) to gain entrance, which was a bit surprising.   \n",
